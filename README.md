#  AI & Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of AI and Machine Learning projects! This repository contains a variety of projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, model development, deep learning, and more.

##  Overview

This repository includes hands-on implementations of concepts from:

- **Machine Learning**
- **Deep Learning**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **MLOps and Model Deployment**

##  Tools & Libraries

Some of the main tools and libraries used across these projects:

- **Python**
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM**
- **TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch**
- **OpenCV, YOLO, Hugging Face Transformers**
- **FastAPI, Flask** (for deployment)
- **Docker, MLflow, Weights & Biases**

##  Project List

| Project | Description | Tools |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `image-classifier` | Image classification using CNN | TensorFlow, Keras |
| `text-summarizer` | NLP-based abstractive summarization | Hugging Face, Transformers |
| `stock-prediction` | Time series forecasting | LSTM, Pandas, Scikit-learn |
| `chatbot` | Conversational AI with intent recognition | Rasa, NLU |
| `face-recognition` | Face detection and recognition system | OpenCV, Dlib |

##  Future Plans

- Implement AutoML pipelines
- Add more MLOps examples
- Integrate real-time model serving
- Include end-to-end project workflows

##  Why This Repo?

This repo serves as both a **learning journey** and a **showcase portfolio** for my development as an AI/ML engineer.
